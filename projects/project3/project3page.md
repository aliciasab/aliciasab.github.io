## Introduction

## Methods
I used data from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/developers/) and the Vera Institute of Justice for this project. The Vera Institute of Justice compiled an Incarceration Trends dataset, which is freely available on [their github page](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends).  Counties in the United States are defined as __,___,___,___ based on density.
