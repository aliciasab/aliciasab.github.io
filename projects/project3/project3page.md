## Introduction
The history of mass incarceration in the United States begins with the "end" of slavery: the ammendment to the Consitution that abolished slavery in the United States, also enabled the state to control people who have committed crimes as property (cite). In the south, where a majority of enslaved people were held, [finish sentence]. 

Recently, there has been a shift in the geography of incarceration in the United States. Prisons are now increasingly incarcerating people outside of their county, in rural areas. This trend holds on average for the United States (chart 1). 

The U.S. Census categorizes counties as urban, small/mid metropolitan, suburban, and rural as a way to classify density. Additionally, the U.S. Census divides the country up into the South, the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest. In this project, I am to examine the rural incarceration boom, and determine whether this rural shift occured in all regions of the United States.

## Methods
I used data from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/developers/) and the Vera Institute of Justice for this project. The Vera Institute of Justice compiled an Incarceration Trends dataset, which is freely available on [their github page](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends).  

In R, I transformed and querey the data and created plots and shapefiles to visualize the shift in incarceration in the United States. 
To determine a relationship, I used the coefficient of determination.
